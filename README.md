About these drills: This is one of many coding exercise drills I have designed and created to keep my skills sharp, and practice the fundamentals. The purpose of these drills is to be able to pick one and throw it together in just a few minutes from scratch, without help from AI or libraries. Each exercise is meant to target different types of code, while being fast and fun!

Note: These drills are for personal use and aren’t meant to be collaborative (yet!). They’re public so I can document and show my learning journey and ideas. I’m still new to GitHub, but I plan to work up to more professional things like pull requests and collaboration over time.
